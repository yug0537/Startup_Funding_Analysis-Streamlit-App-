# Startup_Funding_Analysis-Streamlit-App-
An interactive Streamlit dashboard that analyzes startup funding trends in India using Python, Pandas, and Plotly

## Executive Summary

This project is an interactive Startup Funding Analysis Dashboard built using Streamlit and Python to explore and visualize startup funding trends in India. It allows users to gain meaningful insights into the startup ecosystem by analyzing overall investments, individual startups, and key investors.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:
  - Provide data-driven insights into India’s startup funding landscape.
  - Enable users (investors, analysts, students) to explore how funding has evolved over time.
  - Build a real-world project using data analytics, visualization, and app development skills.

## Key Features
- Interactive Web UI: Developed using Streamlit with a modern dark-themed interface.
- Three-level Navigation:
  - Overall Analysis – Total, average, and maximum funding, number of startups, and a month-on-month breakdown.
  - Startup View – Individual startup funding history, with filtering and funding trends.
